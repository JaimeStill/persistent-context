# Consolidation Baseline Performance Results

## Test Environment
- **LLM**: phi3:mini via Ollama
- **Service**: persistent-context running on localhost:8543
- **Hardware**: Local system running Ollama

## Manual Performance Testing

### Simple Prompts
- **Simple greeting**: "Hello, how are you?" → **13-14 seconds**
- **Medium consolidation**: 3 bullet points → **17-18 seconds**

### Key Finding: Prompt Size vs Processing Time
The relationship between prompt size and processing time is clearly exponential:
- Small prompt (72 chars): ~13s
- Medium prompt (329 chars): ~18s
- Large prompt (7 x multi-KB memories): **Timeout after 120+ seconds**

## Test Data Analysis
Our stress test dataset contains 7 memories with file contents:
- Each memory: ~6-8KB of repeated code/config content
- Total content size: ~45KB (for all 7 memories)
- When converted to consolidation prompt: **Massive payload**

## Root Cause Identified
1. **Single LLM Request**: Current approach sends all memories in one consolidation request
2. **Prompt Size Explosion**: 7 large memories create prompts of 50KB+ 
3. **Ollama Processing Time**: Scales exponentially with prompt size
4. **Timeout Threshold**: Default 30s timeout is insufficient for large batches

## Performance Limits Discovered
- **Practical limit**: ~3-5 memories per consolidation request
- **Time per memory**: ~3-6 seconds additional processing time
- **Safe batch size**: 1-3 memories to stay under 30s timeout

## Implications for Real Claude Code Sessions
- Typical session: 200-500 memories
- With current approach: Would require 60-200+ separate consolidation calls
- Total processing time: 20-60+ minutes of blocking operations
- **Conclusion**: Current approach is fundamentally unscalable

## Next Steps Required
1. **Alternative Approaches**: Test streaming, hierarchical, and graph-based methods
2. **Batch Size Limits**: Implement intelligent batching (3-5 memories max)
3. **Async Processing**: Move consolidation to background operations
4. **Progressive Consolidation**: Process incrementally, not in large batches

## Technical Details
- Ollama model: phi3:mini (3.8B parameters, Q4_0 quantization)
- Response times are consistent across multiple runs
- Network overhead is minimal (~local requests)
- Bottleneck is clearly LLM processing time, not infrastructure
