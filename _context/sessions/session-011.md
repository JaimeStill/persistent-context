## Architecture Design

### Enhanced Memory Scoring

```go
type MemoryScore struct {
    BaseImportance  float64   // Original importance (0.0-1.0)
    DecayFactor     float64   // Time-based decay (0.0-1.0)
    AccessFrequency int       // Number of access events
    LastAccessed    time.Time // Most recent access time
    CompositeScore  float64   // Final calculated score
}

type Memory struct {
    // existing fields...
    Score           MemoryScore
    AssociationIDs  []string    // Related memory references
}
```

### Association Graph

```go
type MemoryAssociation struct {
    SourceID     string    // Memory ID
    TargetID     string    // Associated memory ID
    Strength     float64   // Association strength (0.0-1.0)
    Type         string    // "temporal", "semantic", "causal"
    CreatedAt    time.Time
}
```

### Persona Structure

```go
type Persona struct {
    ID          string            // Unique persona identifier
    Name        string            // Human-readable name
    Version     int               // Version number
    CreatedAt   time.Time         // Creation timestamp
    Metadata    map[string]any    // Additional metadata
    MemoryIDs   []string          // Associated memory references
}
```

## Success Criteria

- Memory scoring includes decay factors and access frequency tracking
- Association tracking captures and queries memory relationships effectively
- Persona import/export enables memory snapshot management
- All enhancements integrate cleanly with existing consolidation system
- Performance maintained while adding new memory intelligence features

### Session Extensions & MCP Integration

**Extended Session 11 Work - MCP Architecture Refactoring**

Following the core memory enhancement work, the session was extended to test and refactor the MCP integration architecture:

1. **Architectural Analysis** (10 minutes)
   - Identified redundant VectorDB/LLM access in MCP server
   - Recognized cleaner architecture: Claude Code → MCP → Web Server → {VectorDB, LLM}
   - Planned HTTP client approach for MCP server

2. **Configuration Refactoring** (15 minutes)
   - Renamed StorageConfig → PersonaConfig for semantic clarity
   - Fixed double unmarshal issue in MCP configuration (same as web server)
   - Updated environment variable naming: server_endpoint → web_api_url
   - Cleaned docker-compose.yml to only include non-default values

3. **HTTP Client Implementation** (20 minutes)
   - Created internal/http/client.go implementing complete Journal interface
   - Refactored MCP server to use HTTP client instead of direct database access
   - Simplified MCP application dependencies and health checks
   - Fixed data type mismatches and added missing interface methods

4. **Integration Testing** (15 minutes)
   - Successfully rebuilt and deployed all services
   - Verified web server responds correctly on port 8543
   - Confirmed MCP server connects to web server via HTTP
   - All Docker services running healthy

5. **Documentation Updates** (10 minutes)
   - Updated README.md with Quick Start guide and VS Code integration
   - Created VS Code settings configuration for Claude Code MCP integration
   - Documented clean architecture pattern

### Final Status

**ALL SESSION 11 OBJECTIVES COMPLETED** including extended MCP integration work.

**POST-SESSION 11 UPDATE (Session 12)**: MCP architecture was further simplified by removing containerized MCP server and switching to local binary execution for Claude Code integration. This eliminates stdio communication complexity while maintaining clean separation of concerns.

### Architecture Evolution

**Session 11 End State**: Claude Code → MCP Container → Web Server → {VectorDB, LLM}  
**Session 12 Simplified**: Claude Code → Local MCP Binary → Web Server → {VectorDB, LLM}

**Changes Made in Session 12**:
- Removed `persistent-context-mcp` service from docker-compose.yml
- Updated `.vscode/settings.json` to use `./server/bin/mcp` locally
- Simplified Docker stack to essential services only (Qdrant, Ollama, Web)
- Updated README.md with local MCP build instructions

### Next Session Priorities

**Session 12 Priority: Claude Code Integration Testing** (UPDATED)

1. **MCP Binary Setup**
   - Build local MCP binary: `cd server && go build -o bin/mcp ./cmd/mcp/`
   - Test Claude Code integration with simplified configuration

2. **Production Validation & Advanced Features**
   - Test memory capture via Claude Code
   - Validate association discovery in real usage
   - Performance testing with actual workloads

3. **Advanced Persona Features**
   - Complete persona-memory integration
   - Add persona versioning and branching
   - Implement persona merge capabilities

4. **Advanced MCP Features**
   - Specialized sensors (file-watcher, git-monitor)
   - Memory analysis and insights API
   - Automated consolidation triggers
