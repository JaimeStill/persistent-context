# Session 8 Execution Plan: Journal API Implementation and Memory Features

## Overview

Session 8 focuses on implementing the actual journal HTTP endpoints that were deferred from Session 7, and enhancing the memory system with procedural memory patterns, metacognitive capabilities, and advanced memory features. The session builds directly on Session 7's successful HTTP server debugging and clean journal package architecture.

## Technical Focus Areas

### Current Architecture Status

From Session 7:
- HTTP server successfully starts and responds to health checks
- Journal package renamed from memory with clean interfaces
- Configuration system fully updated with journal naming
- Docker environment stable with all services healthy
- Build system standardized to `bin/app`

### Journal API Requirements

1. **Storage Operations**: Store new memories with automatic embedding generation
2. **Retrieval Operations**: Get memories by ID, timestamp, or search criteria
3. **Search Operations**: Vector similarity search with configurable thresholds
4. **Consolidation Operations**: Manual consolidation triggers and status checking
5. **Batch Operations**: Bulk memory storage and retrieval capabilities

### Memory Enhancement Objectives

1. **Procedural Memory**: Extract behavioral patterns from repeated interactions
2. **Metacognitive Layer**: Self-reflection and meta-learning capabilities
3. **Improved Scoring**: Enhanced importance algorithms beyond access frequency
4. **Association Networks**: Track relationships between memories
5. **Forgetting Curve**: Implement memory decay and importance adjustment

### Success Criteria

- Complete journal HTTP API with all CRUD operations functional
- End-to-end memory workflow validated through HTTP interface
- Procedural memory extraction implemented and tested
- Metacognitive layer functional with self-reflection capabilities
- Enhanced memory scoring and association tracking working
- System architecture ready for Session 9's persona management features

## Notes

- Focus on implementing practical journal API endpoints before advanced features
- Ensure all endpoints integrate properly with existing journal service
- Test thoroughly before moving to enhancement features
- Document API design decisions for future client development
