# Session 5 Execution Plan: Production Integration and Containerization

## Overview

Session 5 focuses on completing the integration of the consolidation system and establishing a production-ready containerized deployment. This session resolves the final integration gaps from Session 4 and validates the complete system end-to-end.

## Session Progress

### 0. Documentation Setup (5 minutes) - IN PROGRESS

- [x] Archive Session 4 execution plan to `_context/sessions/session-004.md`
- [ ] Create new execution plan for Session 5
- [ ] Update CLAUDE.md if needed

### 1. Consolidation Service Integration (15 minutes) - PENDING

**1.1 Create Consolidation Service (10 minutes)**

- [ ] Create `app/services/consolidation.go` service wrapper for consolidation engine
- [ ] Implement proper service lifecycle management (Initialize, Start, Stop, HealthCheck)
- [ ] Add service dependencies and configuration integration

**1.2 Service Registry Integration (5 minutes)**

- [ ] Integrate consolidation service into orchestrator's service registry
- [ ] Wire consolidation engine into memory service middleware (replace TODO placeholder)
- [ ] Test consolidation event triggering and context window safety

### 2. Docker Environment Optimization (20 minutes) - PENDING

**2.1 Dockerfile Fixes (5 minutes)**

- [ ] Fix server/Dockerfile build path issue (currently builds from ./cmd/main.go, should be ./main.go)
- [ ] Validate Docker build process and binary location

**2.2 Environment Variable Configuration (15 minutes)**

- [ ] Add comprehensive environment variables to docker-compose.yml:
  - HTTP Server configuration (3 variables)
  - VectorDB configuration (8 variables)
  - LLM configuration (7 variables)
  - Memory configuration (5 variables)
  - MCP configuration (8 variables)
  - **Consolidation configuration (9 variables) - Currently missing entirely**
- [ ] Organize variables by priority and maintain sensible defaults
- [ ] Test configuration loading and validation with environment variables

### 3. Runtime Integration Testing (20 minutes) - PENDING

**3.1 Docker Stack Validation (10 minutes)**

- [ ] Start complete Docker stack (Qdrant, Ollama, persistent-context)
- [ ] Validate service connectivity and network communication
- [ ] Test Docker health checks and startup dependencies

**3.2 End-to-End Workflow Testing (10 minutes)**

- [ ] Test memory capture → storage → consolidation workflow
- [ ] Validate service health checks and graceful shutdown scenarios
- [ ] Verify configuration loading and service initialization order
- [ ] Test consolidation event triggering under realistic conditions

### 4. Documentation and Session Handoff (5 minutes) - PENDING

- [ ] Update execution-plan.md with Session 5 results and accomplishments
- [ ] Document any issues discovered and next steps for Session 6
- [ ] Update tasks.md with new priorities for future sessions

## Technical Focus Areas

### Current Architecture Status

From Session 4, the system has:

- Complete service orchestration with dependency injection
- Event-driven consolidation engine with context window safety
- Integrated memory processing middleware pipeline
- Comprehensive configuration management system

### Critical Gaps to Address

1. **Missing Consolidation Service Integration**: Engine exists but not wired into service registry
2. **Incomplete Docker Configuration**: Only 6 of 50+ config options exposed via environment variables
3. **Build Path Issues**: Dockerfile references incorrect main.go path

### Success Criteria

- Consolidation service fully integrated and functional
- Complete environment variable coverage for all configuration options
- Successful Docker build and multi-service startup
- End-to-end memory workflow validation with consolidation
- Production-ready deployment ready for Session 6 enhancements

## Session 5 Results

### Major Accomplishments

1. **Complete Consolidation Service Integration**: Successfully integrated consolidation engine as managed service
   - Created `app/services/consolidation.go` with proper lifecycle management
   - Integrated consolidation service into orchestrator service registry with correct dependencies
   - Wired consolidation engine into memory service middleware pipeline
   - Established clean cross-service dependency wiring pattern

2. **Production-Ready Docker Environment**: Enhanced Docker configuration for reliable service orchestration
   - Added comprehensive health checks for Qdrant, Ollama, and persistent-context services
   - Implemented `depends_on` with `condition: service_healthy` for proper startup ordering
   - Added complete environment variable coverage (50+ configuration options)
   - Fixed Dockerfile build path to use standardized `bin/server` output

3. **gRPC Configuration Resolution**: Solved TLS mismatch causing "http2: frame too large" errors
   - Identified root cause as protocol mismatch, not frame size issue
   - Added explicit `QDRANT__SERVICE__ENABLE_TLS=false` to Qdrant configuration
   - Simplified gRPC address parsing to `host:port` format
   - Maintained clean configuration-driven architecture without hardcoded values

4. **Enhanced Service Architecture**: Improved service lifecycle and dependency management
   - Implemented formal cross-service wiring phase in orchestrator
   - Added proper dependency injection for consolidation service
   - Enhanced build standards with consistent `bin/server` output path
   - Cleaned up configuration structure removing unnecessary complexity

### Current Status

**Completed:**

- Consolidation service fully integrated and wired
- Docker health checks and service dependencies configured
- gRPC TLS configuration properly aligned
- Build system standardized with proper output paths
- Environment variable configuration comprehensive

**Architecture Achievements:**

- Production-ready service orchestration with health-based startup ordering
- Clean consolidation engine integration with event-driven memory processing
- Simplified but robust gRPC configuration eliminating protocol mismatches
- Maintainable configuration architecture with clear separation of concerns

### Next Session Priority

Session 6 should focus on:

1. **End-to-End Testing**: Complete runtime validation of memory workflow with consolidation
2. **Performance Validation**: Test consolidation triggers and context window safety under load
3. **API Enhancements**: Add REST endpoints for consolidation management and monitoring
4. **Hierarchical Memory System**: Begin implementation of procedural memory from repeated patterns

### Issues and Blockers

**Resolved in Session 5:**

- RESOLVED: Service startup race conditions (fixed with health checks)
- RESOLVED: gRPC "http2: frame too large" errors (TLS mismatch resolved)
- RESOLVED: Consolidation engine integration (fully wired)
- RESOLVED: Docker configuration gaps (comprehensive environment variables added)

**Remaining Work:**

- Runtime testing of complete system with Docker services
- Validation of consolidation event triggering under realistic conditions
- Performance optimization based on actual usage patterns

## Notes

- Focus on production readiness and complete system integration
- Validate all components work together under realistic Docker conditions
- Establish clean foundation for Session 6's hierarchical memory features
- Ensure comprehensive configuration flexibility for deployment scenarios
