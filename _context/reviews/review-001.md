# Project Review 001: Comprehensive Architecture Assessment and MVP Roadmap

**Date**: July 14, 2025  
**Type**: Comprehensive Project Review  
**Status**: Complete

## Overview

This comprehensive review evaluated the persistent-context project against its original vision, strategic plan, and current implementation state. The review was conducted after successfully achieving MCP integration with Claude Code but before backend stability issues were resolved.

## Review Objectives

- Evaluate current codebase structure and implementation
- Analyze alignment with original vision and requirements
- Assess progress against strategic plan and MVP requirements
- Identify gaps between current state and MVP requirements
- Recommend architectural adjustments for scalability
- Establish clear path to demonstrable MVP

## Current State Assessment

### Major Achievement: MCP Integration Complete

**✅ Successful Integration**: All 10 MCP tools are connected and communicating with Claude Code via the official Go SDK. This represents crossing a critical technical threshold.

**Architecture**: Claude Code → Local MCP Binary → Web Server → {VectorDB, LLM}

- MCP Protocol: Fully compliant with JSON-RPC 2.0 and MCP 2025 specification
- Communication Layer: Official Go SDK ensuring robust stdio transport
- Tool Registration: All 10 tools properly registered with type-safe parameters

### Critical Backend Issues

**❌ Backend Stability**: HTTP 500 errors in key endpoints (`get_memories`, `trigger_consolidation`) and data consistency issues (stats show 0 memories while queries find 10) prevent the system from functioning as intended.

**Impact**: While MCP integration is complete, the core memory loop cannot be demonstrated due to backend instability.

## Vision Alignment Analysis

### Original Vision (from _context/summary.md)

- Autonomous LLM memory consolidation inspired by human critical period development
- Hierarchical memory system (episodic → semantic → procedural → metacognitive)
- Sleep-like consolidation cycles
- Portable persona files for memory persistence
- Symbiotic intelligence as evolutionary step

### Current Implementation Status

**Well-Aligned Components:**

- Hierarchical memory structure architecture exists
- Sleep-like consolidation cycles designed but not functioning
- Autonomous context capture via MCP "sensory organs" working
- Persona portability foundation implemented
- Clean separation of concerns in codebase

**Vision Gaps:**

- No demonstrated memory evolution over time
- Consolidation engine exists but can't run due to backend issues
- "Critical period" concept not yet observable in practice
- Autonomous learning unproven due to backend instability

## Strategic Plan Assessment

### Post-MVP Strategic Goals (from .artifacts/strategic-plan.md)

- Technical blog post/paper publication
- Demo video creation
- Portfolio integration
- Strategic outreach to Anthropic and AI labs

### Current Readiness for Strategic Plan

**Blockers:**

1. Backend stability prevents core memory loop demonstration
2. Data persistence unclear - memories may not be properly stored
3. End-to-end validation not possible with current issues
4. Philosophical demonstration impossible without working memory system

**Requirements for Strategic Plan:**

- One complete memory lifecycle demonstration
- Session continuity proof of concept
- Memory evolution over time
- Compelling use case story

## Architectural Recommendations

### 1. Multi-Service Architecture Clarification

**User Feedback**: The multi-service architecture is intentional due to fundamental deployment differences:

- **MCP server**: Local binary, installed via `go install`, runs on user's machine
- **Web service**: Containerized stack with Qdrant/Ollama, potentially remote

This separation is crucial for the primary use case of seamless Claude Code session transitions.

### 2. Project Layout Refactor

**Proposed Structure:**

```
persistent-context/
├── cmd/
│   ├── persistent-context-mcp/     # Local MCP binary
│   └── internal/                   # MCP-specific internals
├── web/
│   ├── persistent-context-svc/     # Containerized web service
│   ├── internal/                   # Web-specific internals
│   └── Dockerfile                  # Web service container
├── pkg/                           # Shared packages
│   ├── types/                     # Common types
│   ├── config/                    # Shared config
│   └── logger/                    # Shared logging
└── docker-compose.yml             # Full stack
```

**Benefits:**

- Clear separation of concerns between MCP and Web boundaries
- Appropriate visibility with `internal/` packages
- Shared foundation via `pkg/` without coupling
- Deployment clarity for what runs where

### 3. MVP Scope Reduction

**Current State**: 10 MCP tools with complex configuration system
**Proposed MVP**: 4-5 essential tools with simplified configuration

**Essential MCP Tools:**

- `capture_memory` - Core capture functionality
- `get_memories` - Memory retrieval for session continuity
- `trigger_consolidation` - Demonstrate memory evolution
- `get_stats` - Validation and monitoring
- `search_memories` - For session continuity demo

**Features to Defer:**

- Complex filtering/debouncing (use simple defaults)
- Multiple consolidation strategies
- Advanced persona management
- Metrics/monitoring beyond basic stats
- Profile inheritance

### 4. Primary Use Case Focus

**Identified Use Case**: Seamless Claude Code session transitions

- Install MCP server and configure to point to web services
- Claude Code benefits from memory features across sessions
- When exiting and re-initializing Claude Code, memories persist
- Persona feature as MCP config defining context and memories

**Strategic Value:**

- Immediately valuable (solves real pain point)
- Demonstrable (easy to show in video)
- Philosophically aligned (shows memory creating continuity)

## Revised Critical Path to MVP

### Session 12: Project Layout Refactor + Ruthless Simplification (4-5 hours)

**Objectives:**

1. Create new directory structure (`cmd/`, `web/`, `pkg/`)
2. Move ONLY essential code for core memory loop
3. Reduce MCP tools to 4-5 essential ones
4. Remove placeholder endpoints and unused features
5. Simplify configuration to bare essentials
6. Verify minimal viable build

**Rationale**: Single disruption combining file moves with code removal for maximum efficiency.

### Session 13: Backend Stabilization (3-4 hours)

**Objectives:**

1. Debug and fix HTTP 500 errors in journal handlers
2. Resolve data consistency between stats and query results
3. Ensure memory persistence actually works end-to-end
4. Validate consolidation engine can execute without errors
5. Test with refactored structure

### Session 14: Backend Feature Completion (3-4 hours)

**Objectives:**

1. Implement missing consolidation triggers
2. Complete memory decay/scoring if not functioning
3. Ensure association tracking works properly
4. Validate persona can capture session context
5. Test memory evolution over time

### Session 15: Core Loop Demonstration (2-3 hours)

**Objectives:**

1. Full workflow: capture → consolidate → retrieve
2. Session continuity demonstration across Claude Code restarts
3. Memory evolution visualization
4. Validate all pieces work together seamlessly

### Session 16: MVP Polish & Launch Prep (3-4 hours)

**Objectives:**

1. Create README with quickstart guide
2. Record compelling demo video showing session continuity
3. Write blog post draft with philosophical framework
4. Prepare strategic outreach materials

## Testing Philosophy

**User Preference**: Integration testing over formal test suites

- **Approach**: Stand up container stack, build binary, verify behavior manually
- **Rationale**: Avoid technical debt of formal testing infrastructure

**Simple Build Process:**

```bash
# Start the stack
docker-compose up -d

# Build and install MCP binary
go install ./cmd/persistent-context-mcp/

# Manual verification through Claude Code interaction
```

**Validation Strategy:**

- Clear indicators of success (logs, stats endpoints)
- Manual verification through actual usage
- Focus on running actual code rather than mocks

## Key Decisions Made

1. **Architecture**: Multi-service approach maintained due to deployment realities
2. **Structure**: Project layout refactor to be combined with scope reduction
3. **Scope**: Ruthless simplification to 4-5 essential MCP tools
4. **Use Case**: Focus on session continuity as primary demonstration
5. **Testing**: Integration testing approach with simple Go builds
6. **Timeline**: 6-session roadmap to demonstrable MVP

## Strategic Implications

### Immediate Impact

- Clear path from current state to working demonstration
- Reduced complexity enables faster iteration
- Session continuity provides compelling use case story

### Long-term Vision

- Simplified MVP enables future enhancement based on real usage
- Clean architecture supports scaling to full symbiotic intelligence vision
- Demonstrated memory persistence opens door to advanced features

## Conclusion
