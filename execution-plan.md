## Key Architectural Design

### Event-Driven Consolidation Architecture

```go
// Consolidation events with context awareness
type ConsolidationEvent struct {
    Type             EventType
    Trigger          string
    Memories         []Memory
    ContextState     ContextState
    Timestamp        time.Time
}

type EventType int
const (
    ContextInit EventType = iota
    NewContext
    ThresholdReached
    ConversationEnd
)

type ContextState struct {
    WindowSize       int
    CurrentUsage     int
    EstimatedCost    int
    CanProceed       bool
}
```

### Service Architecture

```go
// Service orchestrator manages all services
type Orchestrator struct {
    registry    *lifecycle.Registry
    config      *config.Config
    services    map[string]services.Service
}

// Pipeline middleware for memory processing
type Pipeline struct {
    stages      []MiddlewareFunc
    worker      *ConsolidationWorker
    eventQueue  chan ConsolidationEvent
}
```

### Memory Importance Scoring

```go
type MemoryScore struct {
    AccessCount      int
    LastAccessed     time.Time
    SemanticRelevance float32
    DecayFactor      float32
    TotalScore       float32
}

func (c *ConsolidationEngine) scoreMemory(m *Memory) MemoryScore {
    // Multi-factor scoring algorithm
}
```

## Success Criteria

- **Configuration Management**: Comprehensive, validated configuration system
- **Clean Architecture**: Proper separation of concerns and testable components

## Notes

- Extended development session allows for complete feature implementation
- Focus on event-driven consolidation rather than time-based cycles
- Ensure consolidation never causes context window overflow
- Design for extensibility to add more event types later
- Keep implementation simple but robust
