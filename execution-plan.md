# Session 1 Execution Plan

## Overview

This document details the execution plan for Session 1 of the Persistent Context project. The goal is to establish core infrastructure and project structure within a 1-hour timeframe.

## Pre-Session Setup

1. Ensure Docker is installed and running
2. Ensure Go 1.21+ is installed
3. Have terminal and IDE ready

## Execution Steps

### 1. Project Documentation (15 minutes)

- [x] Update claude.md with project directives
  - Session time constraints
  - Design principles
  - Technical preferences (Docker containers)
  - No emoji directive
- [x] Add projected repository structure to claude.md
- [x] Create tasks.md with 3-session breakdown
- [x] Create this execution plan

### 2. Infrastructure Setup (15 minutes)

- [x] Create server directory
- [x] Initialize Go module: `go mod init github.com/JaimeStill/persistent-context`
- [x] Create docker-compose.yml with:
  - Qdrant container with persistent storage
  - Ollama container with GPU support
  - Automatic Phi-3 model download
- [x] Create Dockerfile for Go server
- [x] Update docker-compose.yml to include Go server service

### 3. Memory Type Definitions (15 minutes)

- [x] Create internal/memory/types.go with:
  - Memory interface
  - EpisodicMemory struct
  - SemanticMemory struct
  - ProceduralMemory struct
  - MetacognitiveMemory struct
- [x] Define common memory operations:
  - Store()
  - Retrieve()
  - Query()
  - Transform()

### 4. MCP Server Foundation (10 minutes)

- [x] Create internal/mcp/server.go with:
  - Basic MCP server structure
  - Context capture interface
  - Tool registration framework
- [x] Define capture_context tool

### 5. Main Application Entry Point (5 minutes)

- [x] Create cmd/main.go with:
  - Environment-based configuration
  - Docker-aware service endpoints
  - Health check endpoint
  - Graceful shutdown handling

### 6. Docker Integration and Testing (10 minutes)

- [x] Create go.sum file (run go mod tidy)
- [x] Test Docker build process
- [x] Update docker-compose.yml to include Go server service
- [x] Test full docker-compose stack startup
- [x] Verify health endpoint responds correctly
- [x] Ensure all services can communicate

## Container-First Design Decisions

1. **Configuration**:
   - All service URLs via environment variables
   - `QDRANT_URL=http://qdrant:6333`
   - `OLLAMA_URL=http://ollama:11434`

2. **File Storage**:
   - Persona storage in `/data/personas` (mounted volume)
   - Logs to stdout for Docker logging

3. **Networking**:
   - Use Docker service names for inter-container communication
   - Expose HTTP health endpoint on port 8080

4. **Dockerfile Structure**:
   - Multi-stage build for small image size
   - Non-root user for security
   - Health check command

## Success Criteria

- All services can be started with `docker-compose up`
- Go server runs as a container alongside Qdrant and Ollama
- Services can communicate using Docker networking
- Basic project structure is in place
- Memory types are defined and documented

## Next Steps (Session 2)

- Implement actual memory capture via MCP
- Create vector embedding pipeline
- Connect to Qdrant for storage
- Test end-to-end memory flow

## Session 1 Results

### Completed Successfully

**Infrastructure & Setup:**

- Project documentation and structure established
- Clean, organized Go project with proper separation of concerns
- Docker containerization with health checks
- Organized volume structure under `./data/`

**Core Components:**

- Viper-based configuration management with validation
- Gin-based HTTP server with health/ready/metrics endpoints
- Memory type interfaces (episodic, semantic, procedural, metacognitive)
- MCP server foundation with configurable enablement
- Structured logging with slog
- In-memory storage with HealthChecker interface

**Docker Integration:**

- Multi-stage Dockerfile with security best practices
- Complete docker-compose stack (Go server, Qdrant, Ollama)
- Optimized Ollama startup with conditional model pulling
- Health checks and service communication verified

**Session Improvements:**

- Enhanced volume organization for cleaner directory structure
- Resolved Docker Compose version warnings
- Implemented smart phi3:mini model downloading
- Proper configuration management for MCP server

### Ready for Session 2

The foundation is solid for implementing:

- Qdrant vector storage integration
- Memory capture and retrieval pipeline
- Vector embedding with Ollama
- Memory ingestion workers
- End-to-end testing

## Notes

- Keep implementations minimal but extensible
- Focus on interfaces over implementations
- Ensure all code follows Go idioms
- Design for containerization from the start
