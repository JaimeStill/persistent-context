# Blockers

This document is intended to capture things to resolve before the start of the next session.

Have Claude Code validate whether there are standardized libraries available that would simplify the approach for the following:

- [logging](../server/pkg/logger/) - particularly with consideration for integration with observability platforms
- [mcp](../server/internal/mcp/)
- [memory](../server/internal/memory/)
- [storage](../server/internal/storage/)
