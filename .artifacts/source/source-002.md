# Source Documentation 002: Memory Association Tracking System

## Overview

The Memory Association Tracking System is like a **social network for memories**. Just as Facebook or LinkedIn maps connections between people, this system maps relationships between memories. It helps the AI understand not just individual memories, but how they relate to each other in a web of knowledge.

### The Problem It Solves

Imagine if your brain stored memories as isolated, disconnected facts:
- "I learned Python"
- "I built a web scraper"
- "I fixed a bug in my code"
- "I attended a Python conference"

Without connections, you'd miss the bigger picture! The human brain naturally links related memories - when you think of Python, you automatically recall projects you built, problems you solved, and events you attended. Our association system gives AI this same capability.

## Architecture Context

This association system enhances the memory consolidation pipeline:

```
Memory Flow with Associations:
1. New memory captured → MemoryEntry created
2. Association analyzer examines relationships → Creates connections
3. Memory scoring considers associations → Related memories boost importance
4. Consolidation uses association network → Groups related memories intelligently
5. Retrieval follows associations → "Thinking of X reminds me of Y"
```

## Function-by-Function Breakdown

### 1. AssociationTracker (The Relationship Manager)

```go
type AssociationTracker struct {
    // In-memory association storage (could be moved to persistent storage later)
    associations map[string]*types.MemoryAssociation
    // Index for quick lookups by source memory
    sourceIndex map[string][]*types.MemoryAssociation
    // Index for quick lookups by target memory
    targetIndex map[string][]*types.MemoryAssociation
}

func NewAssociationTracker() *AssociationTracker {
    return &AssociationTracker{
        associations: make(map[string]*types.MemoryAssociation),
        sourceIndex:  make(map[string][]*types.MemoryAssociation),
        targetIndex:  make(map[string][]*types.MemoryAssociation),
    }
}
```

**What it does**: Manages a graph of memory relationships with efficient lookup capabilities.

**Analogy**: Like a librarian's card catalog system that cross-references books by multiple criteria. You can quickly find all books by an author (source index) or all books that reference a topic (target index).

**The Three-Index Design**:
1. **Main storage** (`associations`): The complete relationship records
2. **Source index**: "What memories does this memory connect TO?"
3. **Target index**: "What memories connect TO this memory?"

**Why This Design**: Bidirectional indexing enables O(1) lookups for finding all relationships of a memory, crucial for real-time association traversal.

### 2. CreateAssociation (The Connection Builder)

```go
func (at *AssociationTracker) CreateAssociation(
    sourceID, targetID string, 
    associationType types.AssociationType, 
    strength float64, 
    metadata map[string]any
) *types.MemoryAssociation {
    association := &types.MemoryAssociation{
        ID:        uuid.New().String(),
        SourceID:  sourceID,
        TargetID:  targetID,
        Type:      associationType,
        Strength:  strength,
        CreatedAt: time.Now(),
        UpdatedAt: time.Now(),
        Metadata:  metadata,
    }
    
    // Store association
    at.associations[association.ID] = association
    
    // Update indexes
    at.sourceIndex[sourceID] = append(at.sourceIndex[sourceID], association)
    at.targetIndex[targetID] = append(at.targetIndex[targetID], association)
    
    return association
}
```

**What it does**: Creates a new relationship between two memories with type and strength.

**Analogy**: Like drawing a line between two points on a map and labeling it with the type of road (highway, street, path) and how well-traveled it is (strength).

**Key Parameters**:
- **Source/Target IDs**: Which memories to connect
- **Type**: Nature of relationship (temporal, semantic, causal, contextual)
- **Strength**: How strong the connection is (0.0-1.0)
- **Metadata**: Additional context about the relationship

### 3. GetAssociationsForMemory (The Relationship Finder)

```go
func (at *AssociationTracker) GetAssociationsForMemory(memoryID string) []*types.MemoryAssociation {
    var associations []*types.MemoryAssociation
    
    // Get associations where this memory is the source
    if sourceAssocs, exists := at.sourceIndex[memoryID]; exists {
        associations = append(associations, sourceAssocs...)
    }
    
    // Get associations where this memory is the target
    if targetAssocs, exists := at.targetIndex[memoryID]; exists {
        associations = append(associations, targetAssocs...)
    }
    
    return associations
}
```

**What it does**: Finds all relationships involving a specific memory, regardless of direction.

**Analogy**: Like finding all roads connected to a city - both roads leaving the city and roads entering it.

**Bidirectional Search**: This is crucial because relationships can be meaningful in both directions. If Memory A is related to Memory B, then B is also related to A.

### 4. AssociationAnalyzer (The Pattern Detector)

```go
type AssociationAnalyzer struct {
    tracker *AssociationTracker
}

func NewAssociationAnalyzer(tracker *AssociationTracker) *AssociationAnalyzer {
    return &AssociationAnalyzer{
        tracker: tracker,
    }
}
```

**What it does**: Automatically discovers relationships between memories using various algorithms.

**Analogy**: Like a detective who looks for connections between clues using different investigation methods - timeline analysis, evidence similarity, witness statements.

### 5. AnalyzeTemporalAssociations (The Timeline Detective)

```go
func (aa *AssociationAnalyzer) AnalyzeTemporalAssociations(
    ctx context.Context, 
    memory *types.MemoryEntry, 
    recentMemories []*types.MemoryEntry, 
    timeWindow time.Duration
) {
    for _, otherMemory := range recentMemories {
        if otherMemory.ID == memory.ID {
            continue // Skip self
        }
        
        // Calculate time difference
        timeDiff := math.Abs(float64(memory.CreatedAt.Sub(otherMemory.CreatedAt)))
        
        // If within time window, create temporal association
        if time.Duration(timeDiff) <= timeWindow {
            strength := aa.calculateTemporalStrength(time.Duration(timeDiff), timeWindow)
            metadata := map[string]any{
                "time_diff_minutes": timeDiff / float64(time.Minute),
                "created_at":        time.Now().Unix(),
            }
            
            aa.tracker.CreateAssociation(
                memory.ID,
                otherMemory.ID,
                types.AssociationTemporal,
                strength,
                metadata,
            )
        }
    }
}
```

**What it does**: Finds memories that occurred close together in time and links them.

**Analogy**: Like how you naturally associate events that happened on the same day - "I remember having coffee before that important meeting."

**The Time Window Concept**: 
- Memories within the window are considered related
- Closer in time = stronger relationship
- Helps maintain context from conversations or learning sessions

### 6. AnalyzeSemanticAssociations (The Meaning Matcher)

```go
func (aa *AssociationAnalyzer) AnalyzeSemanticAssociations(
    ctx context.Context, 
    memory *types.MemoryEntry, 
    candidateMemories []*types.MemoryEntry, 
    similarityThreshold float64
) {
    if memory.Embedding == nil || len(memory.Embedding) == 0 {
        return // Cannot analyze without embeddings
    }
    
    for _, otherMemory := range candidateMemories {
        if otherMemory.ID == memory.ID {
            continue // Skip self
        }
        
        if otherMemory.Embedding == nil || len(otherMemory.Embedding) == 0 {
            continue // Skip memories without embeddings
        }
        
        // Calculate cosine similarity between embeddings
        similarity := aa.calculateCosineSimilarity(memory.Embedding, otherMemory.Embedding)
        
        // If similarity is above threshold, create semantic association
        if similarity >= similarityThreshold {
            metadata := map[string]any{
                "similarity_score": similarity,
                "created_at":       time.Now().Unix(),
            }
            
            aa.tracker.CreateAssociation(
                memory.ID,
                otherMemory.ID,
                types.AssociationSemantic,
                similarity,
                metadata,
            )
        }
    }
}
```

**What it does**: Finds memories with similar meaning using mathematical comparison of their embeddings.

**Analogy**: Like a wine expert identifying similar wines by comparing their flavor profiles - even if they're from different regions, similar characteristics create connections.

**Embeddings Explained**: 
- Each memory has a numerical "fingerprint" (embedding) representing its meaning
- Similar meanings have similar numbers
- We measure similarity using cosine similarity (explained below)

### 7. AnalyzeContextualAssociations (The Context Connector)

```go
func (aa *AssociationAnalyzer) AnalyzeContextualAssociations(
    ctx context.Context, 
    memory *types.MemoryEntry, 
    contextMemories []*types.MemoryEntry
) {
    memorySource := ""
    if memory.Metadata != nil {
        if source, ok := memory.Metadata["source"].(string); ok {
            memorySource = source
        }
    }
    
    if memorySource == "" {
        return // Cannot analyze without source context
    }
    
    for _, otherMemory := range contextMemories {
        if otherMemory.ID == memory.ID {
            continue // Skip self
        }
        
        otherSource := ""
        if otherMemory.Metadata != nil {
            if source, ok := otherMemory.Metadata["source"].(string); ok {
                otherSource = source
            }
        }
        
        // If from same source/context, create contextual association
        if otherSource != "" && otherSource == memorySource {
            strength := 0.7 // Moderate strength for contextual associations
            metadata := map[string]any{
                "shared_context": memorySource,
                "created_at":     time.Now().Unix(),
            }
            
            aa.tracker.CreateAssociation(
                memory.ID,
                otherMemory.ID,
                types.AssociationContextual,
                strength,
                metadata,
            )
        }
    }
}
```

**What it does**: Links memories that share the same context or source.

**Analogy**: Like organizing photos by event - all pictures from the same wedding are related, even if they show different moments.

**Context Sources**:
- Same conversation thread
- Same document or file
- Same user session
- Same project or task

### 8. calculateCosineSimilarity (The Similarity Calculator)

```go
func (aa *AssociationAnalyzer) calculateCosineSimilarity(embedding1, embedding2 []float32) float64 {
    if len(embedding1) != len(embedding2) {
        return 0.0 // Cannot compare vectors of different dimensions
    }
    
    var dotProduct, norm1, norm2 float64
    
    for i := 0; i < len(embedding1); i++ {
        dotProduct += float64(embedding1[i]) * float64(embedding2[i])
        norm1 += float64(embedding1[i]) * float64(embedding1[i])
        norm2 += float64(embedding2[i]) * float64(embedding2[i])
    }
    
    // Avoid division by zero
    if norm1 == 0.0 || norm2 == 0.0 {
        return 0.0
    }
    
    return dotProduct / (math.Sqrt(norm1) * math.Sqrt(norm2))
}
```

**What it does**: Measures how similar two embedding vectors are using cosine similarity.

**Analogy**: Like measuring the angle between two arrows - arrows pointing in the same direction have high similarity (small angle), while perpendicular arrows have low similarity.

**Why Cosine Similarity?**:
- **Scale-invariant**: Measures direction, not magnitude
- **Range**: Always between -1 and 1 (we typically see 0 to 1 for embeddings)
- **Intuitive**: 1.0 = identical, 0.0 = unrelated, -1.0 = opposite

**The Math Simplified**:
1. **Dot Product**: Multiply corresponding numbers and sum (measures alignment)
2. **Norms**: Calculate the "length" of each vector
3. **Normalize**: Divide by lengths to get pure direction comparison

## Key Design Patterns Demonstrated

### 1. **Graph Data Structure**
The association system implements an in-memory graph database:
- Nodes: Memories
- Edges: Associations
- Properties: Type, strength, metadata

### 2. **Bidirectional Indexing**
Maintains both forward and reverse indexes for O(1) lookups in either direction.

### 3. **Strategy Pattern**
Different association analyzers (temporal, semantic, contextual) implement different strategies for finding relationships.

### 4. **Similarity Metrics**
Uses appropriate similarity measures for different data types:
- Time-based: Inverse distance
- Semantic: Cosine similarity
- Contextual: Exact matching

## Integration with Memory System

The association system enhances memory operations:

```go
// During memory retrieval
relatedMemoryIDs := tracker.GetRelatedMemoryIDs(memoryID)
// Fetch and return related memories for richer context

// During consolidation
associations := tracker.GetAssociationsForMemory(memoryID)
// Use associations to group related memories for joint consolidation

// During scoring
associationCount := len(tracker.GetAssociationsForMemory(memoryID))
// Highly connected memories are more important
```

## Learning Points

1. **Graph Theory**: Relationships form a graph structure enabling complex traversals
2. **Indexing Strategies**: Multiple indexes trade memory for speed
3. **Similarity Measures**: Different algorithms for different relationship types
4. **Temporal Locality**: Events close in time are often related
5. **Semantic Similarity**: Mathematical comparison of meaning through embeddings
6. **Context Preservation**: Shared context creates implicit relationships

## Future Enhancements

1. **Persistent Storage**: Move associations to vector database for durability
2. **Causal Analysis**: Detect cause-and-effect relationships between memories
3. **Association Decay**: Weaken unused associations over time
4. **Clustering**: Group highly interconnected memories automatically
5. **Path Finding**: Navigate from one memory to another through associations
6. **Association Learning**: Learn optimal association parameters from usage patterns

## The Bigger Picture

This association system transforms isolated memories into an interconnected knowledge graph, similar to how the human brain creates rich, contextual memories. When combined with the scoring system, it enables:

- **Contextual Retrieval**: "This reminds me of..."
- **Intelligent Consolidation**: Group related memories naturally
- **Knowledge Discovery**: Find unexpected connections
- **Memory Reinforcement**: Strengthen important memory clusters
