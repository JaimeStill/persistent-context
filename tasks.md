## Session 3: Service Architecture & Event-Driven Consolidation - COMPLETED

**Objective**: Build service registration architecture and event-driven memory consolidation system.

**Major Deviations from Original Plan**:

- **Architecture First**: Implemented comprehensive service registration and lifecycle management system instead of jumping directly to consolidation
- **Event-Driven vs Time-Based**: Switched from 6-hour timer cycles to event-driven consolidation based on LLM lifecycle events (context init, new context, threshold reached, conversation end)
- **Interface Abstractions**: Created VectorDB and LLM interfaces for better modularity and testability
- **Package Reorganization**: Merged storage→memory packages and created shared types package

**Completed Tasks**:

1. [x] **Service Architecture Implementation** (30 minutes)
   - Created `app/` package with services, lifecycle, middleware, pipelines directories
   - Implemented base service interface with initialization, startup, shutdown, health checks
   - Built service registry with dependency resolution and startup ordering
   - Created lifecycle manager for graceful shutdown handling

2. [x] **Interface Abstraction Layer** (20 minutes)
   - Created VectorDB interface (`internal/vectordb/vectordb.go`) with Qdrant implementation
   - Created LLM interface (`internal/llm/llm.go`) with Ollama implementation
   - Built service wrappers for all components (vectordb, llm, memory, http, mcp)
   - Enabled easy swapping of implementations (e.g., LocalAI, OpenAI for LLM)

3. [x] **Package Reorganization** (15 minutes)
   - Merged `internal/storage` into `internal/memory` for better cohesion
   - Created `internal/types` package to resolve import cycles
   - Moved all memory types to shared location
   - Updated all imports and references

4. [x] **Configuration & API Compatibility** (15 minutes)
   - Updated memory config to use `uint64` for BatchSize/MaxMemorySize to match VectorDB requirements
   - Fixed HTTP server to accept HTTPConfig instead of full Config
   - Updated Qdrant client to use modern Go client API (Query vs Search methods)
   - Fixed method signatures and response handling

5. [x] **Foundation for Event-Driven Consolidation** (10 minutes)
   - Designed event system architecture (ContextInit, NewContext, ThresholdReached, ConversationEnd)
   - Planned context window safety mechanisms to prevent consolidation overflow
   - Created structure for memory importance scoring and lifecycle management

**Deliverables**:

- Complete service registration and lifecycle infrastructure
- Interface-based architecture with dependency injection
- Reorganized packages with resolved import cycles
- Foundation ready for event-driven consolidation pipeline
- Comprehensive documentation of architectural decisions

**Deferred to Session 4**:

- ~~Complete import cycle fixes (update memory/store.go and qdrantdb.go imports)~~ ✅ COMPLETED
- ~~Build app orchestrator and update main.go~~ ✅ COMPLETED
- ~~Implement memory pipeline with middleware~~ ✅ COMPLETED
- ~~Create consolidation engine with event handlers~~ ✅ COMPLETED
- ~~Add context window safety and lifecycle management~~ ✅ COMPLETED

## Session 4: Complete Integration & Event-Driven Consolidation - COMPLETED

**Objective**: Resolve all Session 3 blockers and implement complete event-driven consolidation system.

   - Created `app/orchestrator.go` with complete service lifecycle management
   - Implemented dependency injection for all services (vectordb, llm, memory, http, mcp)
   - Updated main.go to use service registry instead of manual initialization
   - Fixed service configuration integration and parameter passing

3. [x] **Event-Driven Consolidation Engine** (45 minutes)
   - Created `internal/consolidation/engine.go` with complete event system
   - Implemented context window monitoring with safety margins
   - Added memory importance scoring with access frequency and decay factors
   - Created background consolidation worker with event queue
   - Implemented all consolidation events: OnContextInit, OnThresholdReached, OnConversationEnd
   - Added configurable thresholds and context usage monitoring

4. [x] **Memory Processing Middleware** (15 minutes)
   - Created `app/middleware/` package with pipeline architecture
   - Implemented middleware components: validation, enrichment, logging, routing, consolidation
   - Separated concerns into individual files following config package pattern
   - Integrated middleware pipeline into memory service with `ProcessMemory` method
   - Removed unused `app/pipelines/` directory
