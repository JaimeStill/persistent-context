# Persistent Context - Development Tasks

## Overview

This document outlines the first 3 development sessions for building the Autonomous LLM Memory Consolidation System. Each session is designed to fit within approximately 1 hour of focused work.

## Session 1: Core Infrastructure Setup - COMPLETED

**Objective**: Establish the foundational infrastructure and project structure.

**Tasks**:

1. [x] Update claude.md with project-specific directives
2. [x] Add projected repository structure to claude.md
3. [x] Create server directory and initialize Go module
4. [x] Create docker-compose.yml for Qdrant and Ollama
5. [x] Create tasks.md and execution-plan.md
6. [x] Define memory type interfaces and basic structs
7. [x] Create basic MCP server skeleton
8. [x] Write main.go with basic service initialization

**Additional Completed Tasks**:

- [x] Implement Viper-based configuration management
- [x] Create Gin-based HTTP server with health endpoints
- [x] Set up structured logging with slog
- [x] Organize Docker volumes under ./data/ structure
- [x] Optimize Ollama startup with conditional model pulling
- [x] Test complete Docker integration

**Deliverables**:

- Working Docker environment with Qdrant and Ollama
- Clean Go project structure with proper organization
- Defined memory interfaces and storage layer
- Functional MCP server framework
- Health monitoring and logging infrastructure

## Session 2: Memory Pipeline Implementation - COMPLETED

**Objective**: Implement the core memory capture and storage pipeline.

**Tasks**:

1. [x] Implement distributed configuration architecture with package-specific configs
2. [x] Create vector embedding pipeline using Ollama with caching and retry logic
3. [x] Set up Qdrant client and collections with health checks
4. [x] Implement comprehensive storage operations (store, retrieve, query, batch processing)
5. [x] Create memory consolidation system (episodic → semantic transformation)
6. [x] Add robust logging, error handling, and health monitoring
7. [ ] Write integration tests for memory pipeline (deferred to Session 3)
8. [ ] Test end-to-end memory capture and storage (deferred to Session 3)

**Additional Completed Tasks**:

- [x] Resolve import cycle issues with clean configuration architecture
- [x] Implement memory similarity search and querying capabilities
- [x] Create LLM-powered memory consolidation
- [x] Add comprehensive configuration validation and defaults
- [x] Build health check infrastructure across all components
- [x] Implement structured logging with slog

**Deliverables**:

- Distributed configuration system with no import cycles
- Functional vector embedding generation with Ollama integration
- Complete Qdrant integration with collection management
- Advanced memory storage with similarity search and consolidation
- Robust error handling and health monitoring infrastructure

## Session 3: Service Architecture & Event-Driven Consolidation - COMPLETED

**Objective**: Build service registration architecture and event-driven memory consolidation system.

**Major Deviations from Original Plan**:

- **Architecture First**: Implemented comprehensive service registration and lifecycle management system instead of jumping directly to consolidation
- **Event-Driven vs Time-Based**: Switched from 6-hour timer cycles to event-driven consolidation based on LLM lifecycle events (context init, new context, threshold reached, conversation end)
- **Interface Abstractions**: Created VectorDB and LLM interfaces for better modularity and testability
- **Package Reorganization**: Merged storage→memory packages and created shared types package

**Completed Tasks**:

1. [x] **Service Architecture Implementation** (30 minutes)
   - Created `app/` package with services, lifecycle, middleware, pipelines directories
   - Implemented base service interface with initialization, startup, shutdown, health checks
   - Built service registry with dependency resolution and startup ordering
   - Created lifecycle manager for graceful shutdown handling

2. [x] **Interface Abstraction Layer** (20 minutes)
   - Created VectorDB interface (`internal/vectordb/vectordb.go`) with Qdrant implementation
   - Created LLM interface (`internal/llm/llm.go`) with Ollama implementation
   - Built service wrappers for all components (vectordb, llm, memory, http, mcp)
   - Enabled easy swapping of implementations (e.g., LocalAI, OpenAI for LLM)

3. [x] **Package Reorganization** (15 minutes)
   - Merged `internal/storage` into `internal/memory` for better cohesion
   - Created `internal/types` package to resolve import cycles
   - Moved all memory types to shared location
   - Updated all imports and references

4. [x] **Configuration & API Compatibility** (15 minutes)
   - Updated memory config to use `uint64` for BatchSize/MaxMemorySize to match VectorDB requirements
   - Fixed HTTP server to accept HTTPConfig instead of full Config
   - Updated Qdrant client to use modern Go client API (Query vs Search methods)
   - Fixed method signatures and response handling

5. [x] **Foundation for Event-Driven Consolidation** (10 minutes)
   - Designed event system architecture (ContextInit, NewContext, ThresholdReached, ConversationEnd)
   - Planned context window safety mechanisms to prevent consolidation overflow
   - Created structure for memory importance scoring and lifecycle management

**Deliverables**:

- Complete service registration and lifecycle infrastructure
- Interface-based architecture with dependency injection
- Reorganized packages with resolved import cycles
- Foundation ready for event-driven consolidation pipeline
- Comprehensive documentation of architectural decisions

**Deferred to Session 4**:

- Complete import cycle fixes (update memory/store.go and qdrantdb.go imports)
- Build app orchestrator and update main.go
- Implement memory pipeline with middleware
- Create consolidation engine with event handlers
- Add context window safety and lifecycle management
