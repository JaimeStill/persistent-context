Duration: 2+ minutes before timeout
```

### Session 16: Consolidation Performance Fix + Service Architecture (2-3 hours)

**🚨 CRITICAL PRIORITY**: Implement batch size limits and progressive consolidation using CLI tool for testing.

**Consolidation Performance Issues to Address First**:

1. **Implement Batch Size Limits**: Cap consolidation groups to 3-5 memories maximum
2. **Progressive Consolidation**: Break large groups into smaller batches with iterative processing  
3. **Timeout Configuration**: Add consolidation-specific timeout settings
4. **Consolidation Strategy**: Consider consolidating pairs first, then consolidating consolidated memories
5. **Resource Management**: Add memory and processing limits to prevent system overload

**Objective**: Refactor monolithic service files into logical domain-based abstractions for improved maintainability and organization.

**Problem Statement**:

Current infrastructure has poor separation of concerns with large monolithic files:

- `src/persistent-context-mcp/app/server.go` (370+ lines) - 5 tool registrations mixed with helper methods
- `src/persistent-context-mcp/app/client.go` (230+ lines) - 6 HTTP client methods in single file  
- `src/persistent-context-svc/app/server.go` (370+ lines) - 9 handlers plus consolidation business logic

**Proposed Structure**:

#### **MCP Server Tool Organization**

```
src/persistent-context-mcp/app/
├── server.go           # Core server + registration
├── tools/
│   ├── memory.go       # Memory CRUD tools (capture, get, search)
│   ├── consolidation.go # Consolidation tool
│   └── stats.go        # Statistics tool
└── client/
    ├── client.go       # Core client + HTTP infrastructure  
    ├── memory.go       # Memory operations (capture, get, search)
    ├── consolidation.go # Consolidation operations
    └── stats.go        # Stats & health operations
```

#### **Web Service Handler Organization**

```
src/persistent-context-svc/app/
├── server.go           # Core server + routing
├── handlers/
│   ├── health.go       # Health, ready, metrics, initialize
│   ├── memory.go       # Memory CRUD (capture, get, search)  
│   ├── consolidation.go # Autonomous consolidation + business logic
│   └── stats.go        # Statistics

## Future Session Ideas

### Interactive Go CLI Tool for Package Investigation

**Objective**: Create a standalone Go CLI tool that provides interactive investigation capabilities for the pkg infrastructure.

**Use Cases**:

- **Development & Debugging**: Interactive exploration of memory contents, associations, and consolidation states
- **System Understanding**: Visual representation of how different components interact
- **Manual Operations**: Ability to trigger specific operations (consolidation, memory cleanup, association analysis)
- **Data Inspection**: Browse vector embeddings, examine memory scoring, trace association graphs
- **Configuration Testing**: Test different configurations and see their effects in real-time

**Potential Features**:

- Interactive shell with commands like `show memories`, `trace associations <id>`, `trigger consolidation`
- Visual memory graph representation showing connections between memories
- Real-time monitoring of consolidation processes and association formation
- Configuration hot-reloading and impact analysis
- Export capabilities for debugging and analysis

**Benefits**:

- Provides deeper understanding of system internals without modifying production code
- Enables thorough investigation of edge cases and system behavior
- Serves as development tool for future enhancements
- Helps bridge the gap between technical implementation and conceptual understanding

**Implementation Notes**:

- Can reuse all existing pkg infrastructure directly
- Provides perfect testbed for manual consolidation scenarios
- Could include both interactive CLI and web dashboard interfaces
- Maintains separation from autonomous production system

## Testing Philosophy

**Approach**: Integration testing with simple build process

- `docker-compose up -d` - Start the stack
- `go install ./cmd/persistent-context-mcp/` - Install MCP binary
- Manual verification through Claude Code interaction

**Focus**: Validate actual functionality rather than formal test coverage
