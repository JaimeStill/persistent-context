# Persistent Context - Development Tasks

## Overview

This document outlines the first 3 development sessions for building the Autonomous LLM Memory Consolidation System. Each session is designed to fit within approximately 1 hour of focused work.

## Session 1: Core Infrastructure Setup - COMPLETED

**Objective**: Establish the foundational infrastructure and project structure.

**Tasks**:

1. [x] Update claude.md with project-specific directives
2. [x] Add projected repository structure to claude.md
3. [x] Create server directory and initialize Go module
4. [x] Create docker-compose.yml for Qdrant and Ollama
5. [x] Create tasks.md and execution-plan.md
6. [x] Define memory type interfaces and basic structs
7. [x] Create basic MCP server skeleton
8. [x] Write main.go with basic service initialization

**Additional Completed Tasks**:

- [x] Implement Viper-based configuration management
- [x] Create Gin-based HTTP server with health endpoints
- [x] Set up structured logging with slog
- [x] Organize Docker volumes under ./data/ structure
- [x] Optimize Ollama startup with conditional model pulling
- [x] Test complete Docker integration

**Deliverables**:

- Working Docker environment with Qdrant and Ollama
- Clean Go project structure with proper organization
- Defined memory interfaces and storage layer
- Functional MCP server framework
- Health monitoring and logging infrastructure

## Session 2: Memory Pipeline Implementation

**Objective**: Implement the core memory capture and storage pipeline.

**Tasks**:

1. [ ] Implement episodic memory capture via MCP hooks
2. [ ] Create vector embedding pipeline using Ollama
3. [ ] Set up Qdrant client and collections
4. [ ] Implement basic storage operations (store, retrieve, query)
5. [ ] Create memory ingestion worker
6. [ ] Add basic logging and error handling
7. [ ] Write integration tests for memory pipeline
8. [ ] Test end-to-end memory capture and storage

**Deliverables**:

- Working MCP server that captures context
- Functional vector embedding generation
- Qdrant integration with proper collections
- Basic memory storage and retrieval

## Session 3: Consolidation Engine

**Objective**: Build the autonomous memory consolidation system.

**Tasks**:

1. [ ] Implement sleep-like consolidation timer (6-hour cycles)
2. [ ] Create episodicâ†’semantic transformation logic
3. [ ] Integrate Phi-3 for memory processing and pattern extraction
4. [ ] Implement forgetting curve algorithm
5. [ ] Create basic persona export functionality
6. [ ] Add consolidation metrics and monitoring
7. [ ] Test consolidation cycles
8. [ ] Document consolidation behavior

**Deliverables**:

- Autonomous consolidation running on schedule
- Memory transformation pipeline
- Basic persona export to Parquet/SQLite
- Initial metrics and observability
