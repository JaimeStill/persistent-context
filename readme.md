# Persistent Context

Autonomous memory consolidation for LLMs. Continuously captures context and distills experiences into persistent, hierarchical memories.

## What It Does

Gives LLMs memory that persists between conversations. The system:

- Captures context automatically
- Consolidates memories in the background
- Maintains different types of memories
- Exports/imports memory "personas"
