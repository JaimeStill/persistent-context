# Vector Embeddings + Qdrant Experiment - Architectural Roadmap

## Experiment Objective

Evaluate vector embeddings with Qdrant storage as a high-quality semantic memory system, comparing multiple embedding providers (Voyage AI, local models, other APIs) to determine optimal approaches for superior association formation and context understanding.

## Architectural Foundation

### Core Hypothesis

Vector embeddings from various providers combined with Qdrant's efficient vector operations can provide semantically rich memory associations and retrieval that significantly outperforms text-only approaches, with different providers offering distinct trade-offs in cost, quality, and operational complexity.

### Key Technical Bets

- **Semantic Quality**: Vector embeddings capture meaning better than text similarity across all providers
- **Association Richness**: Semantic similarity reveals non-obvious memory connections regardless of embedding source
- **Provider Flexibility**: Abstraction layer enables seamless switching between embedding providers
- **Vector Operations**: Qdrant provides efficient similarity search at scale for any embedding dimensions
- **Hybrid Viability**: Multiple providers can coexist for different use cases (development vs production)

## Implementation Phases

- Basic embedding generation and vector storage operations across providers

**Success Criteria**:

- Can generate embeddings via multiple providers using same interface
- Store and retrieve vectors in Qdrant successfully regardless of provider

    Payload map[string]interface{} `json:"payload"`
}

// Enhanced payload structure with provider metadata
type MemoryPayload struct {
    Type             string    `json:"type"`             // episodic, semantic, etc.
    Content          string    `json:"content"`          // Original text content  
    Strength         float64   `json:"strength"`         // Current memory strength
    CognitiveTime    int64     `json:"cognitive_time"`   // When created
