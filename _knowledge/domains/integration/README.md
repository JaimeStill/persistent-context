# Integration Domain

## Overview

System integration patterns showing how different components connect and communicate in the persistent-context architecture. This domain covers the flow of data from external APIs through internal services to storage systems.

## Learning Pathway

### Prerequisites
- `vector-databases/sessions/fundamentals` - Understanding vector storage
- `memory-systems/sessions/processing-pipeline` - Understanding memory flow
- Basic HTTP API concepts

### Planned Sessions
1. **api-to-vectordb-flow.md** (30 min) - Complete data flow tracing
   - HTTP request lifecycle from MCP tools to vector storage
   - Data transformations at each system boundary
   - Error propagation and handling patterns

### Key Concepts Covered
- **Data Flow**: Request → Processing → Storage → Response
- **System Boundaries**: HTTP, Journal, Memory Processor, VectorDB, LLM
- **Transformations**: JSON → Domain Models → Vectors → Storage Format
- **Error Handling**: Graceful degradation and error propagation
- **Async Processing**: Fire-and-forget vs blocking operations

## Integration Points

### **Builds On**
- `vector-databases` - Understanding vector storage operations
- `memory-systems` - Understanding memory processing pipeline
- `go-patterns` - Understanding Go interface and error patterns

### **Provides Understanding For**
- Complete system operation and data flow
- Debugging integration issues
- API design and error handling
- Async processing patterns

## System Architecture

```
Claude Code MCP → HTTP API → Journal Interface → Memory Processor
                                      ↓
LLM Service ← Event Queue ← Background Processing
     ↓              ↓
Vector Generation → VectorDB Storage
```

## Key Integration Patterns

- **Interface Boundaries**: Clean separation between components
- **Async Processing**: Non-blocking operations with event queues
- **Error Boundaries**: Contained failures with graceful degradation
- **Data Transformation**: Format changes at each system layer

## Domain Artifacts

- **domain.yaml** - Concept map of integration flows and patterns
- **sessions/** - Detailed walkthroughs of data flow
- **README.md** - This overview and integration guide

## Session Status

- 📋 api-to-vectordb-flow.md - Planned comprehensive data flow documentation
- 🔄 Additional sessions - API design patterns, error handling deep-dives as needed

This domain provides the complete picture of how your persistent-context system integrates its various components to transform conversation context into searchable, persistent memories.
