# Vector Databases Domain

## Overview

Vector databases are specialized storage systems for high-dimensional numerical arrays that represent semantic meaning. This domain covers the fundamental concepts needed to understand how meaning-based search and similarity retrieval work in AI systems.

## Learning Pathway

### Prerequisites
- Basic understanding of databases and data storage
- Familiarity with AI systems converting text to numbers

### Sessions in Order
1. **fundamentals.md** (45 min) - Core vector database concepts and practical exploration
   - What vectors represent and how similarity works
   - Hands-on exercises with your actual Qdrant system
   - Understanding embeddings and dimensional spaces

### Key Concepts Covered
- Vector embeddings as semantic representations
- Similarity search algorithms (cosine similarity)
- High-dimensional storage and retrieval
- Integration with LLM embedding models

## Integration Points

### **Provides Foundation For**
- `memory-systems` - Vector storage enables memory persistence and retrieval
- `integration` - Understanding how API data becomes searchable vectors

### **Practical Applications**
- Semantic search without exact keyword matches
- Content recommendation systems
- AI memory and context retrieval
- Similarity-based data discovery

## Real-World Context

Vector databases power systems you use daily:
- ChatGPT/Claude finding relevant training examples
- Spotify discovering music you might like
- Google understanding search intent beyond keywords
- Photo apps finding images by description
