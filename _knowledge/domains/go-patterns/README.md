# Go Patterns Domain

## Overview

Go language patterns and idioms used in the persistent-context project. This domain focuses on understanding Go's approach to interfaces, concurrency, and architecture design through practical examples from your codebase.

## Learning Pathway

### Prerequisites

- Basic Go syntax familiarity
- Understanding of interfaces and structs

### Planned Sessions

1. **interfaces-composition.md** (30 min) - Go interface design and composition
   - Interface philosophy: small, focused contracts
   - Implicit interface satisfaction
   - Composition patterns for building complex behavior

2. **concurrency-patterns.md** (30 min) - Channels, goroutines, and concurrent design
   - Event queues with buffered channels
   - Background processing with goroutines
   - Graceful shutdown and context management

3. **architecture-patterns.md** (30 min) - Go-idiomatic system design
   - Dependency injection through struct composition
   - Error handling patterns and error wrapping
   - Package organization and interfaces

### Key Concepts Covered

- **Interface Design**: Single-method interfaces and composition
- **Concurrency**: Channels as first-class communication primitives
- **Error Handling**: Explicit error returns and wrapping
- **Architecture**: Clean separation through interfaces
- **Resource Management**: Context cancellation and defer patterns

## Integration Points

### **Supports Implementation Of**

- `memory-systems` - Concurrency patterns for memory processing
- `integration` - HTTP service architecture patterns
- `vector-databases` - Client interface design and error handling

### **Real Project Examples**

- Memory processor using channels for async event processing
- Journal interface demonstrating Go's interface philosophy
- HTTP handlers with proper error handling and context usage
- VectorDB abstraction showing interface-based design

## Go Philosophy

### Core Principles in Your Project

- **Simplicity**: Clear, readable code over clever abstractions
- **Composition**: Building complex behavior from simple parts
- **Explicitness**: Clear error handling and resource management
- **Concurrency**: Goroutines and channels for concurrent design

## Domain Artifacts

- **domain.yaml** - Concept map of Go patterns used in persistent-context
- **sessions/** - Hands-on learning with actual code examples
- **README.md** - This overview and learning guide

## Session Status

- ðŸ“‹ interfaces-composition.md - Planned based on project interface design
- ðŸ“‹ concurrency-patterns.md - Planned based on memory processor patterns
- ðŸ“‹ architecture-patterns.md - Planned for overall system design patterns
- ðŸ”„ Additional sessions - As specific patterns emerge

This domain helps you understand Go's unique approach to software design through the lens of your actual persistent-context implementation.
