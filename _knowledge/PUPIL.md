# Learning Profile (PUPIL.md)

## Programming Context

### Primary Languages

- Go (current project focus)

### Currently Learning

- Vector databases and persistent memory systems
- Memory consolidation patterns
- Distributed system architectures for AI applications
- Go concurrency patterns (channels, goroutines)

### Project Context

- Building autonomous LLM memory consolidation system
- First exposure to vector database concepts
- Go-based implementation
- Focus on conceptual understanding of memory persistence architecture
- Need to understand data flow from API endpoints to VectorDB

### Knowledge Ratings (1-5 scale)

- pkg/journal: 1 (core memory operations)
- pkg/memory/processor.go: 1 (consolidation engine)
- pkg/vectordb: 3 (vector storage)
- pkg/llm: 3 (LLM integration)
- MCP implementation: 4 (protocol understanding)
- Go patterns: 4 (interfaces, concurrency)

## Learning Style

### Conceptual Approach

- Prefer teaching-focused sessions with clear explanations
- Build understanding through well-structured educational content
- Focus on conceptual foundations before implementation details
- Need practical exercises to follow along with

### Session Preferences

- Flexible timing up to 45 minutes based on complexity
- Start with most fundamental concepts
- Progress systematically through knowledge dependencies
- Sessions should be standalone for execution but may build on foundational knowledge
- Prefer structured practical exercises over pure explanation

### Code Examples

- Go-based examples and implementations
- Practical applications relevant to memory persistence systems
- Clear connection between concepts and implementation patterns

### Foundation Building

- Need comprehensive conceptual understanding before diving into specifics
- Prefer systematic progression from fundamentals to advanced topics
- Focus on "why" questions and architectural reasoning
- Struggle with loose infrastructure associations vs explicit class-based connections

## Mental Models

### Learning Context

- Analogical thinking approach for concept development
- Physical system metaphors can be helpful for understanding abstract concepts
- Prefer explanations that build intuitive understanding alongside technical knowledge

### Current Focus

- Understanding how context converts to memories and evolves
- Memory consolidation algorithm and scoring system
- Association tracking between memories
- Data flow between API endpoints and Vector DB
- Go concurrency patterns for practical design

### Representation Needs

- Conceptual explanations without code for most audiences
- High-level architectural diagrams with implementation rationale for technical audiences
- Need to confidently explain system to various stakeholder types

## Inverse Prompting Preferences

### Frequency

- proactive (gather context before introducing complex topics)

### Depth

- thorough (ensure solid foundation before advancing)

### Timing

- before-topics (when entering new domains)
- when-transitioning (between complexity levels)

## Feedback Loop

- Continuous iterative improvement of learning materials
- Adjustments based on effectiveness
- Goal: Build resources for both immediate learning and future contributors
