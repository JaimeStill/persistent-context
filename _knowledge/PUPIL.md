# Learning Profile (PUPIL.md)

## Programming Context

### Primary Languages
- Go (current project focus)

### Comfortable With
- [Add your existing technical skills]

### Currently Learning
- Vector databases and persistent memory systems
- Memory consolidation patterns
- Distributed system architectures for AI applications

### Project Context
- Building autonomous LLM memory consolidation system
- First exposure to vector database concepts

- Focus on conceptual understanding of memory persistence architecture

## Learning Style

### Conceptual Approach
- Prefer teaching-focused sessions with clear explanations
- Build understanding through well-structured educational content
- Focus on conceptual foundations before implementation details

### Session Preferences
- 30-45 minute focused learning sessions
- Start with most fundamental concepts
- Progress systematically through knowledge dependencies

### Code Examples
- Go-based examples and implementations
- Practical applications relevant to memory persistence systems
- Clear connection between concepts and implementation patterns

### Foundation Building
- Need comprehensive conceptual understanding before diving into specifics
- Prefer systematic progression from fundamentals to advanced topics
- Focus on "why" questions and architectural reasoning

## Mental Models

### Learning Context
- Analogical thinking approach for concept development
- Physical system metaphors can be helpful for understanding abstract concepts
- Prefer explanations that build intuitive understanding alongside technical knowledge

### Current Focus
- Understanding vector database fundamentals
- Memory consolidation and persistence patterns
- Session continuity in AI systems
- Distributed coordination for memory systems

## Inverse Prompting Preferences

### Frequency
- proactive (gather context before introducing complex topics)

### Depth
- thorough (ensure solid foundation before advancing)

### Timing
- before-topics (when entering new domains)
- when-transitioning (between complexity levels)
