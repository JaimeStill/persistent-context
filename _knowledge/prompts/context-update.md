# Prompt: Update Learning Context

Use this prompt to update your PUPIL.md when your preferences, experience, or focus areas change.

## Prompt Template

```
Update my learning context (PUPIL.md) with the following changes:

Programming Experience Updates:
- New languages/tools I'm comfortable with: [list]
- Technologies I've moved away from: [list]
- Current focus areas: [what you're actively working on]

Learning Style Refinements:
- What's been working well: [successful patterns you've noticed]
- What hasn't worked: [approaches that don't click for you]
- Preferred explanation styles: [any new preferences discovered]

Project Context Changes:
- Current projects: [brief description of active work]
- Technical constraints: [any new limitations or requirements]
- Learning priorities: [what's most important now]

Collaboration Preferences:
- Inverse prompting frequency: [more/less/different timing]
- Session duration preferences: [any changes to optimal length]
- Context gathering style: [how detailed questions should be]

Specific Updates:
[Any particular sections of PUPIL.md that need revision]
```

## Example Usage

```
Update my learning context (PUPIL.md) with the following changes:

Programming Experience Updates:
- New languages/tools I'm comfortable with: Rust (basic level), Kubernetes
- Technologies I've moved away from: PHP (no longer relevant to my work)
- Current focus areas: Distributed systems, AI/ML integration

Learning Style Refinements:
- What's been working well: Starting with analogies before technical details
- What hasn't worked: Long theory sections without examples
- Preferred explanation styles: I like seeing failure modes early

Project Context Changes:
- Current projects: Building persistent memory system for AI agents
- Technical constraints: Must work in containerized environments
- Learning priorities: Performance optimization and debugging distributed systems

Collaboration Preferences:
- Inverse prompting frequency: More frequent when entering new domains
- Session duration preferences: 45 minutes works better than 30
- Context gathering style: Quick targeted questions work best

Specific Updates:
Add "AI/ML systems" to my interests, update debugging style to mention I like understanding failure modes
```

## Context Update Triggers

Consider updating when:

- Starting a new project or role
- Learning preferences shift
- Discovering new effective learning patterns
- Technology stack changes
- Time constraints change
- Working in new problem domains

## Integration

The AI will:

1. Review your current PUPIL.md
2. Incorporate your updates thoughtfully
3. Suggest additional refinements based on patterns
4. Maintain the structure while updating content
5. Highlight what changed for your review
