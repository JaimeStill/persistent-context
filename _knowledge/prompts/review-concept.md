# Prompt: Review and Reinforce Concept

Use this prompt when you want to revisit a concept you've studied before, either for reinforcement or to build on prior learning.

## Prompt Template

```
Review my understanding of [CONCEPT] from the Iterative Knowledge framework.

Previous Learning:
- Session(s) completed: [List relevant session files]
- Time since learning: [rough timeframe]
- Confidence level: [high/medium/low/unsure]

Current Context:
- Why reviewing: [Preparing for new work, building on this, felt shaky, etc.]
- Current application: [How you're using or plan to use this knowledge]
- Specific concerns: [What feels unclear or needs reinforcement]

Review Goals:
- [ ] Reinforce core concepts
- [ ] Explore advanced aspects
- [ ] Connect to new knowledge
- [ ] Prepare for application
- [ ] Debug understanding gaps

Format: [Choose one]
- Quick refresher (10-15 minutes)
- Deep review session (30-45 minutes)
- Practical application exercise
- Conceptual connections exploration
```

## Example Usage

```
Review my understanding of "vector databases" from the Iterative Knowledge framework.

Previous Learning:
- Session(s) completed: session-001-vector-databases.md
- Time since learning: 2 weeks ago
- Confidence level: medium

Current Context:
- Why reviewing: About to implement similarity search in production
- Current application: Building memory retrieval system with Qdrant
- Specific concerns: Not sure about index optimization and when to use different similarity metrics

Review Goals:
- [x] Reinforce core concepts
- [x] Explore advanced aspects
- [ ] Connect to new knowledge
- [x] Prepare for application
- [ ] Debug understanding gaps

Format: Practical application exercise (45 minutes)
```

## Output Format

The AI will provide:

1. **Quick Summary**: Key points from your original session
2. **Knowledge Check**: Questions to validate retention
3. **New Perspectives**: Additional ways to think about the concept
4. **Advanced Topics**: Next-level concepts to explore
5. **Practical Applications**: Real-world scenarios to try
6. **Connection Points**: How this relates to other concepts you've learned

## Integration with Learning Journey

This prompt helps:

- Identify knowledge decay before it becomes a problem
- Build bridges between concepts
- Prepare for applying knowledge in new contexts
- Expand understanding incrementally
